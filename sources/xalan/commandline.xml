<s1 title="&xslt4c; Command-Line Utility">
   
   <s2 title="Using the Command-Line Utility">
      <p>To perform a transformation, you can call &xslt4c; from the command line (or script), 
      or from within an application (see <link idref="usagepatterns">Usage Patterns</link>).</p>
     <p>TestXSLT provides a command-line interface
    for performing XSL transformation. To perform a transformation from the command line or a script,
    do the following:</p>
 		<ol>
    <li><link idref="getstarted" anchor="download">Download &xslt4c;</link>.<br/><br/></li> 
    <li><link idref="getstarted"
     anchor="classpath">Set the path</link> to include the build directory.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Call the TestXSLT executable with the appropriate flags and
    arguments (described below). The following command line, for example, includes the -IN, -XSL,
    and -OUT flags with their accompanying arguments -- the XML source document, the XSL
    stylesheet, and the output file:<br/><br/>
    <code>TestXSLT -IN foo.xml -XSL foo.xsl -OUT foo.out</code>
    </li></ol>
    <p>The command line utility can take the following flags and arguments (the flags are case insensitive):</p> 
      <source>-IN inputXMLURL
-XSL XSLTransformationURL
-OUT outputFileName
-ESCAPE chars(Which characters to escape -- default is &lt;>&amp;"'\r\n)
-EER (Expand entity references --default is not to expand)
-V (Version info)
-QC (Quiet Pattern Conflicts Warnings)
-Q  (Quiet Mode)
-INDENT (Number of spaces to indent each level in output tree --default is 0)
-VALIDATE (Validate the XSL and XML input -- default is not to validate)
-TT (Trace the templates as they are being called)
-TG (Trace each result tree generation event)
-TS (Trace each selection event)
-TTC (Trace the template children as they are being processed)
-XML (Use XML formatter and add XML header)
-TEXT (Use simple Text formatter)
-HTML (Use HTML formatter)
The -XML flag must be set:
&nbsp;&nbsp;-NH (Don't write XML header)
The -XML or -HTML flag must be set:
&nbsp;&nbsp;-STRIPCDATA (Strip CDATA sections of their brackets, but do not escape)
&nbsp;&nbsp;-ESCAPECDATA (Strip CDATA sections of their brackets, and escape)
-DOM (Test for well-formed output --format to DOM then to XML for output)
-PARAM name expression (Set a stylesheet parameter)</source>
      <p>Use -IN to specify the XML source document.</p> 
      <p>Use -XSL to specify the XSL stylesheet file.</p>
      <p>Use -TEXT if you want the output to include only text nodes without any escaping.</p>
      <p>Use -HTML to write 4.0 transitional HTML (some elements, such as &lt;br&gt;, are
      not well formed XML).</p>
      <p>To set stylesheet parameters from the command line, use <br/>
      <code>TestXSLT -PARAM <ref>name expression</ref></code><br/>
      To set the parameter to a string value, enclose the string in single quotes (') to
      make it an expression.</p>
