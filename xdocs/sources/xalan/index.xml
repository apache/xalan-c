  <s2 title="What is it?">
    <p>Xalan is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into HTML, text, or other XML
     document types.</p>
    <p>&xslt4c-current; is a robust implementation of the W3C Recommendations 
    for XSL Transformations (XSLT) and the XML Path Language (XPath). It works with a compatible release of the 
    &xml4c; XML parser: &xml4c-used;. The focus for this release is on bug fixes, build support for a number of new platforms, and changes to the Xerces Deprecated DOM support. For the details, see the <link idref="readme">Release Notes</link>.</p>
