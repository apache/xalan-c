<anchor name="download"/>
<p>This section is being rewritten for Xalan-C/C++ Version 1.11.  You
can find the old 
<jump href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-c">Version 1.10</jump> here.
</p>

<p>We are providing a source package, a documentation package, and
some compiled binary packages.
</p>

<p>The binary packages are currently for Windows systems.  We can
use your help <jump href="buildlibs.html">creating binary packages</jump> for 
UNIX and Linux systems.
</p>

<p><em>THIS IS STILL A PRE-RELEASE PRODUCT</em></p>

<p>A distribution will be mirrored and these pages updated when the packages
become available to the general public.  The current packages for download
are in a temporary repository for developers.
</p>

<p>The subversion sources are current for Xalan-C/C++ Version 3.1.1 and are
available for download using your favorite subversion <code>svn</code> program.</p>

<p>Apache Xalan-C/C++ Subversion Repository is accessed here.<br/> 
<jump href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xalan/c/trunk">
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xalan/c/trunk</jump>
</p>

<s2 title="Downloading what you need">

<p>The Xalan-C/C++ library requires 
<jump href="http:xml.apache.org/xerces-c">Xerces-C/C++ XML</jump> Parser 3.0 
or newer, version 3.1.1 is preferred.
</p>

<p>The source package contains all the scripts needed to build the
library, sample programs, and documentation for a wide variety
of Windows and UNIX platforms.  The documentation package provides
usable html documentation for your web browsers.
</p>

<p>Building the API Reference documents requires a current version of the 
<jump href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</jump> and 
<jump href="http://www.graphviz.org">GraphViz</jump> programs for UNIX or Linux. 
We have not tried building the API Reference on a Windows platform.
A usable API Reference is included with the documentation package.
</p>

<s3 title="Source Packages">
<p>We are distributing the source package for the Xalan-C/C++
library, sample programs, and documentation.  The source package
has the StyleBook XML sources for the web pages and a Doxygen
configuration file to construct the API Reference.
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Xalan-C-1.11.source.tar.gz</li>
 <li>Xalan-C-1.11.source.zip</li>
</ul>
</s3>

<s3 title="Documentation Packages">
<p>We are distributing a package of html web pages for the User
Guide and interactive API Reference. The documentation package 
describes how to build and use the library for Windows and UNIX
platforms.
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Xalan-C-1.11.docs-html.tar.gz</li>
 <li>Xalan-C-1.11.docs-html.zip</li>
 <li>Xalan-C-1.11.docs-api.tar.gz</li>
 <li>Xalan-C-1.11.docs-api.zip</li>
</ul>
</s3>

<s3 title="Binary Packages">
<p>We are distributing compiled binary packages for several
platforms.  The Xalan-C/C++ documentation is provided as a
separate package.  We would like to distribute
binary packages for platforms that have compiled Xerces-C/C++
distribution support.
</p>

<p>The following binary packages are being prepared for distribution.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Xalan-C-1.11.windows-x86-vc71.zip</li>
 <li>Xalan-C-1.11.windows-x86-vc8.zip</li>
 <li>Xalan-C-1.11.windows-x86-vc9.zip</li>
 <li>Xalan-C-1.11.windows-x86-vc10.zip</li>
 <li>Xalan-C-1.11.windows-x86_64-vc8.zip</li>
 <li>Xalan-C-1.11.windows-x86_64-vc9.zip</li>
 <li>Xalan-C-1.11.windows-x86_64-vc10.zip</li>
</ul>

<p>We currently have no one committed to release UNIX and Linux
binary packages.  If you have scripts to build these packages,
your help would be appreciated. 
You can contribute by posting your comments to the 
<jump href="mailto:xalan-dev@xml.apache.org">xalan-dev</jump> mailing list.

</p>
<p>Building for platforms other than those listed will require
a build of the Xerces-C/C++ XML Parser library from the sources.
Use of Xalan and Xerces libraries compiled with different versions
of compilers may cause problems</p>

<note>Use GNU tar to untar the Solaris distribution file; see <link idref="faq" anchor="faq-11">A tar checksum error on Solaris
      </link>.
</note>

<p>If you want to take advantage of the support for number formatting, sorting, and encoding the ICU provides, you should also download 
   and install the <resource-ref idref="icu"/>; see <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="icu">Using the ICU</link>,</p>

<p>The IBM ICU is supported with Xerces-C version 2.8.  Xerces-C version 3 has introduced transcoding support modules, currently being evaluated for Xalan XSLT transcoders.
